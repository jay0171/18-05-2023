        Can I style an image in CSS? <br>
        We can use CSS to display our images in our web applications. The styling of images is more similar to styling the elements. Finally, we can use different properties to style an image in CSS.
        CSS Images is a module of CSS that defines what types of images can be used (the <image> type, containing URLs, gradients and other types of images), how to resize them and how they, and other replaced content, interact with the different layout models.The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular element.
